Visual element built purely on top of Xamarin.Forms controls (no platform renderers or platform-specific code) that displays ASCII time series chart via multi-line monospaced Label wrapped in a Grid. The control can resize to adapt to it's container. It was tested on Android, iOS, macOS and WPF though should work fine across Xamarin.Froms supported platforms.
